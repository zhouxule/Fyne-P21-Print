Based on the reverse engineering work from [merlinschumacher/nelko-p21-print](https://github.com/merlinschumacher/nelko-p21-print).

Here are some vibe docs, I really don't expect anyone to use it but if you stumble upon this and think it's useful, create a new issue and I'll help you get it working and get better docs. Just call the issue "Software missing a good onboarding process" or some shit and we'll work it out. I would be down to package for Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage (plus deb/rpm) if there was genuine interest.

## Quick Start

### Linux
```bash
# One-time setup
./setup.sh

# Run the app
./nelko-print
```

### Windows
1. Download `nelko-print.exe` from releases (or build from source)
2. Pair your Nelko P21 via Windows Bluetooth settings
3. Run the app and select your printer's COM port
4. Print!

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linux (x64) | ✅ Full support | Auto Bluetooth connection via rfcomm |
| Windows (x64) | ✅ Full support | Uses COM ports (auto-detected when BT paired) |
| macOS | ❌ Not tested | PRs welcome! |

## Prerequisites

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Zorin)
```bash
# Fyne deps
sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev

# Bluetooth
sudo apt install -y bluez

# Add yourself to dialout group (one-time, then logout/login)
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

### Windows
- Go 1.22+ (for building from source)
- No additional dependencies for running pre-built exe

## Building

### Linux
```bash
make build
# or
go build -o nelko-print ./cmd/nelko-print
```

### Windows (native)
```powershell
go build -o nelko-print.exe ./cmd/nelko-print
```
Use Fyne to avoid the black console window:
```powershell
go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest
fyne package -os windows -icon Icon.png --sourceDir ./cmd/nelko-print
```

### Cross-compile Windows from Linux
```bash
# Install cross-compiler first
make install-cross-deps

# Build Windows exe
make build-windows
```

### Build all platforms
```bash
make build-all
```

## Usage

### Linux - The Easy Way

1. **Pair the printer** via your system's Bluetooth settings (one-time setup)
2. **Run the app**: `./nelko-print`
3. **Select your printer** from the dropdown (auto-detects Nelko devices)
4. **Click Connect** - the app will prompt for your password via `pkexec` to establish the Bluetooth connection
5. **Load an image or type text**, then print!

The app automatically handles the RFCOMM connection that previously required manual terminal commands.

### Windows

1. **Pair the printer** via Windows Settings → Bluetooth & devices
2. **Note the COM port** assigned (check Device Manager → Ports if unsure)
3. **Run the app**: `nelko-print.exe`
4. **Select your COM port** from the dropdown
5. **Click Connect** and print!

On Windows, paired Bluetooth SPP devices appear as COM ports automatically - no special setup needed.

### Manual/Advanced Method (Linux)

If you prefer manual control or the auto-connect doesn't work:

```bash
# Pair the printer first (one-time)
bluetoothctl
> scan on
> pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> quit

# Create RFCOMM device manually
sudo rfcomm connect /dev/rfcomm0 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 1

# Run the app and use "Advanced" section to connect to /dev/rfcomm0
./nelko-print
```

## Features

- **Image printing**: Load PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, WebP images
- **Text labels**: Type text directly with adjustable font size
- **Orientation**: Horizontal or Vertical text layout
- **Invert**: White-on-black or black-on-white
- **Word wrap options**: Break anywhere or only on spaces
- **Multiple copies**: Print multiple labels at once
- **Density control**: Adjust print darkness

## Supported Label Sizes

- 12x40mm
- 14x40mm (default)
- 14x50mm
- 14x75mm
- 15x30mm

## How It Works

The Nelko P21 uses Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP/RFCOMM) for communication.

**On Linux:** The `rfcomm` tool creates a virtual serial device (`/dev/rfcommN`) that the app can write print commands to. The app handles this automatically with privilege escalation.

**On Windows:** Paired Bluetooth SPP devices appear as COM ports automatically. Just select the right COM port and connect.

Both platforms then communicate using TSPL2 print commands over the serial connection.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux

#### "Permission denied" on /dev/rfcomm0
Add yourself to the `dialout` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```
Then log out and back in.

#### rfcomm command not found
```bash
sudo apt install bluez
```

#### pkexec not working / No authentication agent
Install PolicyKit agent for your desktop:
```bash
# GNOME/Zorin
sudo apt install policykit-1-gnome

# KDE
sudo apt install polkit-kde-agent-1
```

### Windows

#### Can't find COM port
1. Open Device Manager
2. Expand "Ports (COM & LPT)"
3. Look for a Bluetooth-related COM port (may say "Standard Serial over Bluetooth link")
4. Note the COM number (e.g., COM3)

#### Printer paired but no COM port appears
Some Windows versions need you to manually add the Serial Port service:
1. Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Devices
2. Click on your printer → More Bluetooth options
3. COM Ports tab → Add → Outgoing → Select your printer

### General

#### Printer not showing in dropdown
Make sure the printer is paired in your system's Bluetooth settings first. The app only shows devices that are already paired.

#### Connection timeout
1. Make sure the printer is powered on and in range
2. Try re-pairing the printer
3. On Linux, use the manual method with `rfcomm connect` to see detailed error messages
